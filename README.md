Artificial evolution

This is a little entertainment project, evolution simulator. The code itself is far from best. Lazily written, a lot of code in headers, unconditional jumps at couple of places etc. I'll make it better in later versions!

## What you need to build it

+ SDL

+ Dear Im GUI

+ sdl + ImGUI Implementation from here
https://github.com/Tyyppi77/imgui_sdl

+ SDL_ttf
https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_ttf

+ Visual studio 2022 and all the tools needed to build C++ apps


## How to run this code

### Manual mode
+ Set include directories for all libraries listed above. And paths for SDL dll-s.  
+ Place imgui_sdl.h, imgui_sdl.cpp and SDL2_ttf.dll at project root, or change #include paths in headers
+ Enjoy!


### Cmake
1. Install packages
    - `cmake` to configure and build project
    - ะก/ะก++ - compiler, for example `g++` or `clang++` / `Visual studio 2022` for Windows.

2. Clone submodules

```console
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
```

3. Make dirrectrory build and enter into it

```console
$ mkdir build && cd build
```

4. Configure project
    - [Windows]: `$ cmake .. -G"Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64`
    - [Linux]: `$ cmake ..`

5. Build

```console
$ cmake --build .
```

## Interface

### Main window
Contains all info about simulation

### System
Info about your PC

### Controls
+ Start/Stop button (Pause/unpause)
+ food - ignore it
+ skip - how many turns you calculate before you draw new frame (set to 0 if you want render on every frame)
+ brush - brush size for mouse actions sich as remove

### Selection
Info about selected bot, some useful buttons to mess with it

### Display
Rendering method. 
+ Bot natural color (just its color)
+ Bot rations (carnivores red, herbivores green, grey if never ate)
+ Energy (yellow = low energy, red = maximum energy)
+ No render means you only compute without rendering, starts to simulate very fast

### Console
Whatever

### Mouse function
Choose what to do with your mouse clicks

### Aditional
Some more windows


## Keyboard

Using keyboard is more handy because interface becomes laggy during simulation

+ "Space" - Start/Pause
+ "Plus sign near numpad" - make 1 step
+ "Backspace" - Spawn group of randoms
+ "Numpad 1-4" - Select render method
